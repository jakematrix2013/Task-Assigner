# Task-Assigner
This will essentially be a program that accepts tasks along with some variables and uses those variables to decide which task should be done first. It's partially random but probability based.


--RANDOMIZE--

With the randomize button, a random task can be assigned to a user after they input several tasks. This doesn't quite work properly as it has no provisions for unexpected entries yet. That'll be last I think. Next step is to implement some algorithm using the 3 parameters.
